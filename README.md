# Dev Bot

Custom Discord Bot for experimentation, learning and fun.

## Hosting the bot
The bot is currently not doing anything because it is not actively hosted.

If you wish to run the bot, follow these steps:
1. Clone this github repository
2. Install npm dependencies (`npm i`)
3. Add your bot auth token in `.env`:
    ``` js
    // .env
    AUTH_TOKEN=gnd87hmp45hs5qyss4p2p87s2mppgsp2gs4p2a7gfmp 
    // obviously, this is not a valid token - replace it with your own
    ```
